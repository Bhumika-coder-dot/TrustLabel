# TrustLabel — Know Before You Buy

TrustLabel is a personal full-stack project that helps users make informed Amazon purchase decisions by analyzing real customer reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

It works as a Chrome Extension that evaluates product reviews and displays a clear decision: **BUY, CAUTION, or AVOID** — along with explainable insights.
